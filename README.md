This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It shows the weather for the Better Developers office in Ã…rhus.

```
Latitude: 56.1518
Longitude: 10.2064
Address: Rosenkrantzgade 19B, 8000 Aarhus C
```

For the project, there have been used a couple of noteworthy tools:

1. Rive animations to display the information beautifully.
2. WeatherAPI.com to fetch weather data for the next 7 days

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Iterations
At first, I had an idea for using a rive file with a phone and its weather widget, but I did not have time to animate it or have it show many scenarios of weather behaviour, so I ended up using another rive file.

#### First idea and result
This idea looks nice, but having the rive animation attached to the bottom of the screen using absolute (aesthetic purposes) was not ideal.

#### Final result
This result was more responsive, as the rive file and overall idea allowed for more free styling.
